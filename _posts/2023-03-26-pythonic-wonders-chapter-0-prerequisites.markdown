### Intro

Welcome to Pythonic Wonders, a comprehensive guide to learning Python programming language! Before we dive into the world of Python, there are a few prerequisites we need to cover. In this chapter, we'll go over how to install PyCharm, an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) that will make our Python programming experience smoother and more efficient. We'll also discuss alternatives to PyCharm and provide instructions for installing Python on both Windows and Linux systems. Our preference is Ubuntu 22, a popular and user-friendly Linux distribution that is great for beginners. By the end of this chapter, you'll have everything you need to get started with Python programming. Let's get started!

#### Operating system for python development

While python can be used on any operating system, Ubuntu 22.04.2 LTS (Jammy Jellyfish) is a popular choice for Python development due to its ease of use and compatibility with many Python libraries. However, Python development can also be done on Windows, although some libraries may not be as compatible as on Linux-based systems.

#### IDE for python development

When it comes to python development, having a reliable Integrated Development Environment (IDE) is crucial. PyCharm is one of the most popular IDEs for Python development due to its rich feature set, ease of use, and strong community support.

However, there are also other alternatives to PyCharm that you can consider, such as Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, and Atom. These IDEs offer similar features and capabilities as PyCharm, but with different user interfaces and workflows.

To install PyCharm, you can download it from the official JetBrains website and follow the installation instructions for your operating system. PyCharm is available in both a free and paid version, with the paid version offering additional features such as support for web development frameworks and database integration.

It's worth noting that while PyCharm is a great choice for Python development, it is not the only option available. Depending on your needs and preferences, other IDEs may better suit your workflow and development style.

#### Tools
##### [GIT](https://git-scm.com/)
Git is a popular version control system used for tracking changes in source code during software development. It is a distributed version control system, which means that multiple users can work on the same project simultaneously, and changes can be easily merged.

Some of the benefits of using Git include:

- Keeping track of changes in code and revert to previous versions if needed
- Collaborating on code with others easily
- Branching and merging code to facilitate feature development and bug fixes

##### [PIP](https://pypi.org/project/pip/)
Pip is a package manager for Python, used to install and manage Python packages. It simplifies the process of installing and managing Python packages and their dependencies.

Some of the benefits of using Pip include:

- Installing Python packages with a single command
- Automatically resolving dependencies for packages
- Upgrading and uninstalling packages with ease

##### [VENV](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html)

Venv is a built-in module in Python used to create isolated Python environments. These environments can have their own Python installations and package dependencies, separate from the main Python installation on the system. This helps to avoid conflicts between different projects that use different versions of the same package.
